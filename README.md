# BoxOfficeRevenue


 Overview
 
This project focuses on predicting box office revenue using data science and machine learning techniques. Implemented in Jupyter Notebook, the project leverages Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and modeling to uncover insights and build predictive models for revenue estimation.

Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for accurate analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.
- Implementation of machine learning models to predict box office revenue.
- Customizable visualizations with colorful bar plots and additional grouping using the `hue` parameter.

Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were utilized in the project:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For advanced data visualization.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- `xgboost`: For building powerful regression models.

How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed in your environment.
3. Install the required Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
   ```
   Alternatively, use Anaconda for package management:
   ```bash
   conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   conda install -c conda-forge py-xgboost
   ```
4. Open the notebook and execute the cells step by step.
